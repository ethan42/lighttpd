# Lighttpd demo
Demonstration of Mayhem on the [lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/)
web server.

We show how Mayhem creates a PoV (proof of vulnerability) exploit for
lighttpd 1.4.15 given just the docker image.

We also show how Mayhem can verify that the vulnerability is fixed
by replaying the PoV -- and an improved test suite! -- on 
lighttpd 1.4.52.
